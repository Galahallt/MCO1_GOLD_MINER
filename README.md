# MCO1 | Gold Miner
The objective of the gold miner is to find the shortest path to the gold mine. Other than the gold mine, the miner needs to consider the following special tiles to calculate the best route to the gold mine:
- `Pit` â†’ the miner falls into the pit and unsucessfully finds the gold mine
- `Beacon` â†’ aids the miner in finding the gold mine since it provides a straight horizontal/vertical line to the gold mine without any `pits` in between

The miner can perform the following actions:
- `Scan` â†’ checks the tiles in a line where the miner is facing
- `Rotate` â†’ rotate the orientation of the miner in a clockwise or counter-clockwise manner
- `Move` â†’ moves the miner one step to the direction it is facing

Enjoy! ðŸ‘¾
